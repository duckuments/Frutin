## Project Architecture

 - DataLayer : In this layer, models and connections to the database are created. The repository pattern is also used, in such a way that a generic repository is used to connect to each table. The dependency of this repository is removed using "dependency injection", which ensures compliance with the rules of solidity and object orientation.
 
 - UtilityLayer : This layer has built-in tools, such as sending emails and converting Gregorian dates to Solar dates.
